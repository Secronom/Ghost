# FUSION

### THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED!
We might work on a completely new version of fusion in the future, however for now we're pretty busy with other important things, so this project can't be maintained.
This should not matter to anyone because this project is meant for other developers and the code should still be extremely benificial for them.

### IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO CHEAT USING FUSION AS YOU ARE LIKELY TO BE BANNED, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

A Lunar Client 1.8.9 Ghost Internal Cheat.

Released as a public repository by hackers for hackers, not pasters.

### Why is this a public release?
Because we wanted a decent resource for other cheat developers to use for when they are stuck with a certain problem when developing their cheats, NOT for random children to download the project and pretend to know what they are doing.

### Notices
- This cheat only works on Lunar Client 1.8.9
- The ESP in works well in third person until your camera starts colliding with blocks, a solution was found however it was not very reliable.
- After having fusion injected for a while, you may experience minor lag spikes, no solution was found.

### How to inject
I'd recommend using a trust worthy dll injector such as [Process Hacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/), the reason why we did not make an injector is because this cheat is meant for other cheat developers.
